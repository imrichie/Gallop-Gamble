# Gallop Gamble

## Description

A command-line horse betting simulator written in C. This project simulates betting on horse races, allowing users to place different types of bets, experience simulated races, and manage a virtual balance.

## Features

- Simulates horse races with four horses.
- Supports various bet types: Exacta, Exacta Box, Trifecta, and Trifecta Box.
- Interactive command-line interface for placing bets and viewing race outcomes.
- Users start with a predefined virtual balance to bet with.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Compile the program: `gcc -o gallop_gamble main.c Bet.c Race.c Utility.c`
4. Run the program: `./gallop_gamble`

## How to Use

After starting the program:

1. Choose a bet type.
2. Enter your horse picks.
3. Watch the race and see if you win.
4. Continue to bet or exit the program.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I've improved my skills in:

- Core C programming concepts: pointers, dynamic memory, modular design.
- Complex logic implementation for race outcomes and betting algorithms.
- Writing maintainable code and effective documentation.

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for the project include:

- Developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for an enhanced user experience.
- Implementing networked multiplayer functionality.
- Expanding betting options and race scenarios.
